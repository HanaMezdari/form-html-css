            Music is found in every known society, past and present, and is considered to be a cultural universal.<br>
            Since all people of the world, including the most isolated tribal groups, have a form of music, it may <br>
            be concluded that music is likely to have been present in the ancestral population prior to the dispersal<br>
            of humans around the world. Consequently, the first music may have been invented in Africa and then evolved <br>
            to become a fundamental constituent of human life, using various different materials to make various instruments.<br>
            A culture's music is influenced by all other aspects of that culture, including social and economic organization<br>
            and experience, climate, access to technology and what religion is believed.
